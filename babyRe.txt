Baby_RE (HTB challenge)

Compeleted

This is a reverse engineering challange. I looked into
the tools I can use. None of them were useful or I couldnt use so I was stuck.
I ended up looking at the permissions that the file has after extracting it. 
Since it said read and write for owner and overall it mainly said that the 
executeable file was executable I knew that i had to plug it into the terminal
to make the file run. Before running it I opened the file using notepad and
leaf pad. When I opened it with leaf pad on the top it showed some binary and ELF.
I then opened the file with notepad and quickly saw that i got more binary data.
I also saw ELF so i went ahead and researched what ELF is. Turns out its the kind 
of file type so that was a good find i did. Now as i scrolled down on note pad I saw
some text that said "run 'strings' on this challenge, that is not the way" so i said
okay i may not have to input any strings or really do a lot of coding. Right next
to that i saw "Insert key: \00abcde122313" here i saw this key that i had to input
somewhere but where. So I went on to research on how to make this file execute and I saw 
that i just go on the terminal cd into the Desktop which is where my file is saved.
Then i type in "chmod +x baby", this changes the permissions into being able to get
executed and not just read and write or just read. After i type in "./baby" to go into
the file and execute it and when i execute it i get a message saying "Insert key:". 
Here is where i feel like a genius even though this is super easy and say THE KEY FROM
NOTE PAD!!! I go on and input abcde122313. After i get another message and the final
message or in terms of hacking i get the flag saying HTB{B4BY_R3V_TH4TS_EZ}. :)
